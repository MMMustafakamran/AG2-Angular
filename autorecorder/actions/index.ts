 *
 * What the recorder *does* on each demo page once it is open.
 *
 * The registry lives here rather than in `core/` on purpose: adding or removing
 * a page must never mean editing frozen code. A page with no entry falls back
 * to `runStandardAction` — type the prompt, submit, wait for the reply — which
 * is right for most pages. Write a handler only when a page needs more than
 * that: switching tabs, clicking an approval button, opening a panel.
 *
 * Handlers should build on the helpers in `core/actions.ts`:
 *
 *   sendPrompt(page, prompt, opts)          types and submits, returns the
 *                                           assistant-message count from before
 *                                           submitting
 *   waitForAgentResponseCompletion(...)     waits for the reply to finish, and
 *                                           throws if none ever arrives
 *   promptsFor(config)                      the page's prompts[] , or [prompt]
 *
 * Pass that returned count into waitForAgentResponseCompletion on multi-turn
 * pages, or the previous turn's reply is mistaken for this one's.
 *
 * ── Every page with a finding writes it down ───────────────────────────────
 * project-context.md: broken pages keep their broken implementation, because
 * "the clip exists to show the defect". But a clip of a feature not working is
 * indistinguishable from a clip of a recorder that mis-clicked, so eight of
 * these handlers end by driving the defect deliberately, resting the cursor on
 * the evidence, and typing the finding into a Notepad window over the top of
 * it — see `finding-note.ts` for the house format and why it is shared.
 *
 * Which is why `quickstart` and `memory` have handlers even though both pass
 * on the standard one. Quickstart's defect is in the doc page rather than the
 * demo, and memory's finding is that there is NO defect — that the guide's
 * isAvailable() gate did its job. Both need saying; neither can be inferred
 * from watching a green clip.
